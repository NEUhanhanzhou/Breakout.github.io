# Post Mortem

I can spend 1 week restructuring my code, including use ResourceManager to load all the resources. Which means all the images, music, sound effect and font should be loaded in the ResourceManager, instead of only loading images. In this week I will add more different kinds of resources and then use maps to store them based on the data type. Next, I will spend 2 weeks constructing a complete UI interface, with which the player can pause the game or restart the game at any time. And then use 2 more weeks to make a game screen made of grids and load all bricks into those girds which means the width and height of each brick will be fixed.

So I have 3 weeks left. Next week, in order to decrease the size of the game, I will study how to use asset files to package resource files instead of putting all the .png or .wav files in a separate folder. In the last 2 weeks, I will try to implement a  customization system in which each player or developer can design the levels with a visualization tool. They can delete levels and add levels whenever they want. This tool can modify the initial position of balls and paddles with the mouse, and move bricks at specified grids.
